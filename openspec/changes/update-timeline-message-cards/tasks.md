## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Implement vertical timeline entry layout with time label, sender/subject summary, and tag/title chips.
- [ ] 1.2 Wire timeline entry selection to reuse the inspector flow (same as canvas node selection).
- [ ] 1.3 Add optional Apple Intelligence tag/title generation with cache and fallback when unavailable.
- [ ] 1.4 Regression: ensure view mode toggle and persistence still behave per spec.
- [ ] 1.5 Add/adjust tests (snapshot or view-model) covering ordering and inspector handoff.
- [ ] 1.6 Run `openspec validate update-timeline-message-cards --strict`.
