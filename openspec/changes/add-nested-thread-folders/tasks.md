## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update ThreadFolder model/persistence to support parent-child relationships and nested membership queries.
- [x] 1.2 Adapt layout generation to build nested folder overlays (stacked frames, widened parents, dynamic header height).
- [x] 1.3 Update folder header rendering to stack multiple header cards and extend parent borders around children.
- [x] 1.4 Expand drag/drop hit testing to target specific nested folders; ensure move/remove operations respect hierarchy.
- [x] 1.5 Animate drop-highlight pulse on the active target folder, including nested cases.
- [x] 1.6 Add/adjust tests or previews to cover nested folders and drag/drop behaviors.
- [x] 1.7 Validate persistence and rethreading with nested folders after refresh/relaunch.
